Reads wave data (unsigned, 8-bit, max ~20200 Hz sample rate) wave file data 
from an EEPROM, and feeds it to a DAC. While it should be part-trivial to use
other EEPROMs/DACs, they have to meet the strict timing constraints... 
especially the DAC. The EEPROM I use is slow (400 kHz I2C, in practice ~31
kilobytes/sec), so 44 kHz sample rate is impossible, as one sample is one byte.

Written for the Microchip 24XX1025 (1024 kbit) I2C EEPROM and the Microchip
MCP49x1 DACs (specfically the MCP4901, the 8-bit version). (I'm not affiliated 
with Microchip, but their stuff is generally high up on the lowest-price-first
sort, and I haven't ran in to anything to complain about yet!)

This project is used together with something that can write the data to the
EEPROM in the first place, such as my EEPROM-serial-data project.

I doubt this is very useful to anyone, at least as-is, but I see no reason to
not share it when doing so is so easy!

As for licensing, I don't really care. If you use it with few modifications,
I prefer being credited somewhere (in the code if open source, at least)... but
I'm hardly going to enforce anything.
